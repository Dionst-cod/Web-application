## Getting Started in a Virtual Environment
Below are instructions on how to start the Event Calendar Application within an isolated development environment (virtual environment):

To set up a virtual environment, start by installing it via your terminal with pip3 install virtualenv. Once that is complete, create a new environment by typing virtualenv env, followed by env/bin/activate to activate it. You are now in the virtual environment—a separate space where you can run your projects without affecting each other.

With your virtual environment active, it’s time to start your Flask application. Run the file with python app.py, and a local address will appear, usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Click this link to go to the website. You will first be directed to a login page. After successfully logging in, you will automatically navigate to the home page of the application.
